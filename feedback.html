        <p>The feedback I received was mostly positive, but the most common criticism I received was that I should add more colour and revise my profile page - make it a bit better. Also, I hadn't finished my blog page at that point, so I needed to revise that as well. I didn't receive any criticism about my homepage, so I didn't change it. I received a lot of criticism about my blog page, that's why I decided to change the whole concept and start from the beginning. I really like what I created and because this is my first time ever using HTML and CSS, therefore it makes me feel more proud of myself.</p>
