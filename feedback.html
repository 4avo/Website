                <h1>Pros</h1>
                <p>Good start! The pros were that I had undersood what I needed to do and I was in the right direction. I showed great interest in doing this assignment. People liked my profile page and my FAQ. My code readability was given a "thumbs up", as it is well structured.
                    The Nav bar was also appreciated and I heard some good things about it.

            <section id="cons">
                <h1>Cons</h1>
                <p>Not enough colour. Missing a blog page. Most pages were almost the same with slight differences. Not enough text and things to look at, too empty. Missing a footer. Code was written in one css file and a lot of copy paste code.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="changes">
                <h1>What did I change?</h1>
                <p>So I decided to change almost everything about my website. Firsly, I changed the bacground with a picture and not just a gradient colour. I added a lot more colour and text to my webpages. The only page that remained the same was the FAQa, as it didn't receive any criticism. I added a blog page and a feedback page. I changed my Dashboard and added "quartiles" because it was missing. I added three blocks in my blog page - Expectations, Feedback, Motivation. Overall I think I fixed all the problems that were issued.</p>
