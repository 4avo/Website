            <h4>Good or bad?</h4>
            <p>The feedback that I received was mostly positive, but the most common critic that I received was that I had to add more colour and fix my profile page - make it a bit better. Also, I hadn't finished my blog page at that time, therefore I had to fix it as well. I didn't receive any criticism about my homepage, that's why I didn't change it.</p>
